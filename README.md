### Columbia_Module_3

## Introduction:

Welcome! Below you will find an explanation of the python script, `crypto_arbitrage`, which reads two crypto exhanges (i.e., bitstamp and coinbase) csv files and outputs potential statistical arbitrages at a specific date at your choosen. A large portion of the python script includes cleaning the raw csv files so that it can be utilized for the arbitrage calculations. By the end, the script will output potential arbitrages along with visual plots to help analyze the results.

## Technologies

The code uses python version 3.7. 

Pandas, pathlib, and matplotlib are all utilized in this script. 

`Pandas` is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool. [^fn1]

`Pathlib` provides an easier method to interact with the filesystem no matter what the operating system is. [^fn2]

`Matplotlib` is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interacted visualizations in Python. [^fn3]
